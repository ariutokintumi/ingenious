-PDF Presentation of "ingenious" project made for ETH DAM 2024: 
-EIP-1155-IPP proposed new functionalities for IP & Patent NFTs.
-Hackathon created website for example purposes: HTML+CSS+JS code.

### Description
The scientific community in 3rd world countries, mainly in Africa and LATAM, face huge problems finding and connecting investors interested in scientific research.

As a consequence, there are also obstacles to protecting intellectual property and/or patenting research and methods.

Under MIT License, we have built this intellectual property and patent NFT marketplace, using our own EIP-1155-IPP variation designed by the DeSci community for the DeSci community, focused on: fractional sales, profit sharing and tokenization of any intellectual property and patents.

An investor (or a SciDegen) can search for PRE-IP NFTs (not yet patented) to gain value when obtaining IP-NFTs (patented), which also activates the NFT multiplier by "N" which will allow the investor to resell new parts of intellectual property.

Sources of investors income: NFT Resale, Sale of their P, distribution of profits.

Scientists Income Sources: Mint, Resell, Portion Selling, Profit Distribution.

### ERC-1155-IPP (IP & Patent) differences:
1. On-Chain Metadata satisfying IP & Patent Schema.
2. Transfer protection with a low "transfer fee" CAP (e.g. 0.1 ETH).
3. Tokens amount multiplier for the "PRE-IP" to "IP" token state update.
4. Profit Auto-Distribution.

### What are our next steps?
-Propose the EIP-1155-IPP to the DeSci Community for discussion.
-Audit the resulting code by experts.
-Find proyects interested in get into the platform.
-Enjoy an Easy-to-Use DeSci Marketplace.
